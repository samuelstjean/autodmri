# Automated characterization of noise distributions in diffusion MRI data

[preprint]: https://doi.org/10.1101/686436
[miccai]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12071
[miccai_publisher]: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-00928-1_35

###  The example and documentation

You can find a quick example and datasets over [here](example) and the full documentation at http://autodmri.rtfd.io/.

### Using Docker

If you have docker, you do not need to install anything else and can use the Dockerfile to get everything.
You can then mount your data folder to run the script and get the results into the same folder like this.

~~~
docker build -t autodmri:v0.2 .
docker run -it -v /home/samuel/git/autodmri/datasets:/mnt autodmri:v0.2 get_distribution /mnt/data_SENSE3_MB3_dwi.nii.gz /mnt/sigma.nii.gz /mnt/N.nii.gz /mnt/mask.nii.gz
~~~

Just be sure to adapt the path and filename of your data or add more options as needed.
