Automated characterization of noise distributions in diffusion MRI data

The conference version of the manuscript (as published in MICCAI 2018) is available [here](https://samuelstjean.github.io/pages/downloads/st-jean_et_al_miccai_2018.pdf) and from the [publisher](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-00928-1_35).

You can find the [preprint of the journal version](https://doi.org/10.1101/686436)
and the datasets are available here https://zenodo.org/record/2483105

The documentation is also available at http://autodmri.rtfd.io/

The code is also autoarchived on zenodo for those wanting to refer to a specific version over here https://zenodo.org/record/3339158

I am currently making the code nicer and easily usable (and am busy with finishing my thesis), but the main script is already present with some data.
I should add shortly after an example.
